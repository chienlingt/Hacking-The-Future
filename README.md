# Hacking the Future - STEM Learning Platform
*My Assignment Project for WIA1002 Data Structure*

This project focuses on bridging the gap in STEM education for young students by providing an engaging, gamified platform that introduces them to the world of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it aims to foster early interest in STEM fields through hands-on learning and rewarding activities.

##User Guide
start the program by running DsAssignment\src\main\java\Login\Home.java

##Key Objectives:
- **STEM Education for All:** Make STEM learning more accessible and engaging for students under 18 through interactive content.
- **Gamification and Rewards:** Users earn points by completing quizzes and participating in STEM events, motivating continuous learning.
- **Industry and Academic Exposure:** Students can explore real-world STEM applications through bookings for tours of STEM-related companies, museums, and discovery centers.
  
##Target Audience:
- **Young Students:** The primary users of the platform, who can engage in quizzes, events, and tours.
- **Parents:** Manage their children’s participation in events and track progress.
- **Educators:** Responsible for creating events and quizzes to enhance the learning experience.
  
##Features:
- **User Accounts and Roles:** Supports multiple user roles (Students, Parents, Educators) with specific permissions and profile management.
- **Event and Quiz Creation:** Educators can create STEM-related events and quizzes, while students can participate and earn rewards.
- **Booking System:** Parents can book tours for their children based on proximity to STEM-related venues, using Euclidean distance calculations.
- **Leaderboards and Social Features:** Includes a points-based leaderboard for students and friend request functionality to promote interaction.
- **Modular and Scalable Design:** Features are built in a modular way, allowing for easy expansion and upgrades.

##Extra Features:
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** While the project supports CLI, a GUI can be implemented for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Database Integration:** Upgrade data storage from CSV or TXT to a full database solution for persistence and scalability.
- **Password Security:** Implement password hashing or encryption for improved user security.

##Technologies:
- JavaFX, MySql
  
## Data Structures: 
Various data structures are implemented to handle user accounts, event management, and bookings efficiently, such as linked list, maps, array and so on.

##Sustainable Development Goals:
SDG 04: Quality Education
SDG 09: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
SDG 17: Partnership for the Goals

This project provides a comprehensive and innovative solution to enhance STEM learning through experiential, gamified, and interactive content.
